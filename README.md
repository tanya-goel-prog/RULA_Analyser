# RULA_Analyser
The goal of the proposed project is to create computer vision software that computes the Rapid
Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) while watching real-time recordings of industrial workers
using various machineries. An ergonomic assessment technique called the RULA score
determines the likelihood that repetitive and uncomfortable postures would result in
musculoskeletal problems.
The software will analyse video feeds to determine the worker's upper body posture using
machine learning methods, and will then compute the RULA score in accordance. By
contrasting the results with footage from six different businesses. The GUI has the ability to assist businesses in evaluating and
enhancing the ergonomic safety of their employees, resulting in more productivity and fewer
workplace accidents.
Uses media pipe.
